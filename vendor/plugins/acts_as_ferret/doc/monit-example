    # to run such services as a non-privileged user)

    # cpu usage boundaries
    if cpu > 60% for 2 cycles then alert
    if cpu > 90% for 5 cycles then restart

    # memory usage varies with index size and usage scenarios, so check how
    # much memory your DRb server uses up usually and add some spare to that
    # before enabling this rule:
    # if totalmem > 50.0 MB for 5 cycles then restart

    # adjust port numbers according to your setup:
    if failed port 9010 then alert
    if failed port 9010 for 2 cycles then restart
