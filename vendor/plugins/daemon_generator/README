Daemon Generator
================

To get yourself rolling:
> sudo gem install daemons
> ./script/generate daemon <name>

Then insert your code in the lib/daemons/<name>.rb stub. All pid's and logs will live in the normal log/ folder.  This helps to make things Capistrano friendly.

Individual control script:
> ./lib/daemons/<name>_ctl [start|stop|restart]

App-wide control script (I add this to my capistrano recipe's after_restart task):
> ./script/daemons [start|stop|restart]
