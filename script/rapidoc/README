Rails Api Doc Generator
Author: JPM van der Meer
=======================
With API DOC one can generate code for a Restful Rails API. 
It generates a API controller, by simply invoking... ./generate. It parses the controllers you specify, and generates a ApiController with appropriate views for it. This makes it very easy to document our Rest API. For methods you use, and according to ERB templates it generates the view for you. It doesn't parse your routes.rb, that was not needed for us, but may be a nice extension for it.

=INSTALL
Please copy this directory into the rails script directory and pass arguments to RAPIDoc into the file ./generate. Then put documentation in your RESFul controllers and start generating api documentation, it will be created into structure.


==Templates
Templates can be used for tuning your method generation and index.html.erb.

==Structure
In the structure folder one can setup some additional views to be used for the apidoc controller generator.

EXAMPLE Class documentation
=begin apidoc
name:: /projects
json:: <%=Project.find(:first).to_json %>
xml:: <%=Project.find(:first).to_xml %>

This resource can be used to show edit and list projects. A project is a one floorplanner. A project
has multiple floors, which can contain multiple designs. 
=end


EXAMPLE Method documentation

=begin apidoc
url:: /projects
method:: GET
access:: FREE
return:: [JSON|XML] - some project  
param:: page:int - the page
param:: per_page:int - max items per page

Get a list of projects. This method uses pagination. If you want to retreive project 1-10 for example:
/projects?page=1&per_page=10.
=end
