Rails Api Doc Generator
Author: Sampo Toiva, based on JPM van der Meer's initial work on rapidoc
=======================
With API DOC one can generate code for a Restful Rails API. 
It generates a API controller, by simply invoking... ./generate. It first parses routes to generate documentation structure for each of the resources. It then parses the controllers based on the data parsed from routes, and generates an ApiControllert. This makes it very easy to document our Rest API. For methods you use, and according to ERB templates it generates the view for you

=INSTALL
Please copy this directory into the rails script directory and pass arguments to RAPIDoc into the file ./generate. Then put documentation in your RESFul controllers and start generating api documentation, it will be created into app/views/api.

==Templates
Templates can be used for tuning your method generation.
